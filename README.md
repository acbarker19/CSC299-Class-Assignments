# CSC299: Making Music with Computers
A repository containing multiple projects from my CSC 299 class, Making Music with Computers, at the University of Mount Union that was taught by Dr. Sarah Huibregtse.

This class uses the Python programming language and utilizes libraries from Jython Music found here: https://jythonmusic.me/

The textbook for this class is used for some exercises. This book is "Making Music with Computers: Creative Programming in Python" by Bill Manaris and Andrew R. Brown.

It contains code that does the following:
- Assignments
    - `Assignments/CH8_Discussion_AlecBarker/ch8_discussion_8-4-1#2.py`: Draws shapes across a window
    - `Assignments/CH8_Discussion_AlecBarker/ch8_discussion_8-6-2.py`: A window with buttons to start and stop notes
    - `Assignments/CH8_Project_AlecBarker` problems 1-3: Creates a piano graphic with notes that can be played on the keyboard
    - `Assignments/CH8_Project_AlecBarker` problems 4-6: Creates a GUI interface that includes sliders, knobs, and buttons
    - `Assignments/CH9_Discussion_AlecBarker`: Creates a server and client that sends and receives messages over OSC networks
    - `Assignments/CH9_Project_AlecBarker`: Receives messages from an OSC device, specifically the "OSC Controller" mobile app on the Google Play Store created by Adam Katz
    - `Assignments/CH10_Discussion_AlecBarker`: Uses sine waves to play notes
    - `Assignments/CH11_Discussion_AlecBarker/boids.py`: Creates a group of boids that flock together
    - `Assignments/CH11_Discussion_AlecBarker/musicalSphere.py`: Uses a group of points to create the illusion of a rotating sphere that plays notes as the points cross an invisible line
